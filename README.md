# Bootcamp Challenge Week ten - Object-Oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


## Description

The purpose of this application is to test my knowledge of Node-js Object-Orriented-Programming and unit testing, by prompting the user for information about their desired logo and then generating  a SVG image from their responses.

This application saves the user from needing a graphic design to create a simple logo.

During this project I learnt how to create classes, to allow for modular programing and how to complete unit tests on code to ensure it working as intended. I have also learnt a significant amonth about how to generate and SVG image from code.
